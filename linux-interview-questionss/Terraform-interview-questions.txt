Terraform manages resource creation order through dependencies, categorized as implicit or explicit.
Implicit Dependencies:
These are automatically inferred by Terraform when one resource's configuration references attributes of another resource.
For example, if a virtual machine resource's network interface configuration references the ID of a previously defined virtual network, Terraform understands that the virtual network must be created before the virtual machine.
Implicit dependencies are generally preferred as they keep the configuration cleaner and allow Terraform to optimize the execution plan more efficiently.
Explicit Dependencies:
These are declared manually using the depends_on meta-argument within a resource block.
Explicit dependencies are used when Terraform cannot automatically infer a dependency, typically when a resource relies on another resource's existence or state, but there's no direct attribute reference in the configuration.
For instance, if an application deployed on a virtual machine requires a specific database to be fully operational before it can start, and there's no direct attribute link between the VM and the database resource in Terraform, an explicit depends_on can be used on the VM resource to ensure the database is created and ready first.
While useful in specific scenarios, overusing depends_on can make the configuration less readable and potentially create unnecessary sequential execution, hindering parallelization.
Summary:
Implicit dependencies: are automatically detected through attribute references, promoting cleaner code and efficient planning.
Explicit dependencies: are manually declared using depends_on for scenarios where automatic inference is not possible, providing control over resource creation order when necessary.
Prioritizing implicit dependencies and using explicit dependencies only when truly required is a best practice for managing Terraform configurations.
