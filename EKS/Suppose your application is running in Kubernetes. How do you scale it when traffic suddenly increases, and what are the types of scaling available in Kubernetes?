Answer (Kubernetes Scaling):
‚ÄúIn Kubernetes, applications run inside Pods. When traffic increases, we can scale the number of Pods to handle the load. Scaling in Kubernetes can be done in three ways:

Manual Scaling ‚Äì Using the kubectl scale command, for example:

kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5


This increases or decreases the number of Pods in the Deployment.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) ‚Äì Kubernetes automatically adjusts the number of Pods based on metrics like CPU or memory usage. For example, if average CPU usage exceeds 70%, Kubernetes can add more Pods.

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) ‚Äì Instead of adding Pods, Kubernetes can increase the CPU/memory resources allocated to existing Pods.

Cluster Autoscaler ‚Äì If the cluster itself runs out of resources, Cluster Autoscaler can provision new worker nodes in AWS EKS, GKE, or AKS.

In my project, we implemented HPA in AWS EKS. For a Node.js application, we configured the HPA to scale Pods between 2 and 10 replicas based on CPU utilization. This ensured high availability during traffic spikes while optimizing cost by scaling down automatically when load decreased.‚Äù

üëâ This answer shows:

You know different scaling options (manual, HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler).

You gave a real project example (Node.js app with HPA in EKS).

You connected it with business value (cost optimization + high availability).
