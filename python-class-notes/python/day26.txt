infinite while loop:
---------------------
infinite while loop means our while condition is always True.

	syntax
	-------
	while condition:
		stmt_1
		stmt_2
		......
		stmt_n

	ref fig: infinite while loop flowchart

ex1:
----
	demo.py
	-------
while True:
    print("hai")

	output
	------
hai
hai
hai
hai
hai
....
...., keep on executeing upto sufficient memory

ex2:

	-------
while 1:
    print("hai")


	output
	------
hai
hai
hai
hai
hai
....
...., keep on executeing upto sufficient memory

while 3<5:
    print("hai")

	output

Jumping/Transform statements:
-----------------------------
the python supported Jumping/Transform statements are,

	1).break
	2).continue
	3).pass

break statement:
-----------------
the break is a keyword in python, which is used in the looping statements.

if we want to exit from the loop execution at the time of middle of the loop execution, in that case we are using break statement.

ex:
---
	demo.py
	-------
i=0
while True:
    print("hai",i)
    if i==3:
        break
    i+=1
print("bye")

	output
	------
hai 0
hai 1
hai 2
hai 3
bye

note:
-----
once the control reach the break statement then immediately the control will comeout from that loop i.e., the control will goto out side the loop.

continue statement:
-------------------
the continue is a keyword in python, which is used in the looping statement.

if we want to skip the execution of one particular iteration, in that case we are using continue statement.

ex:
---
	demo.py
	-------
i=0
while i<5:
    i+=1
    if i==3:
        continue
    print("hai",i)
print("bye")

	output
	------
hai 1
hai 2
hai 4
hai 5
bye

note:
-----
once the control reach the continue statement then immediately the control will goto main loop statement i.e., to skip the execution of remaing statements in our loop body.

ex:
---
	demo.py
	--------
u_c=p_c=0
while True:
    uname=input("enter your user name: ")
    if uname=='siva':
        while True:
            pwd=input("enter your password: ")
            if pwd=='krish@123':
                break
            else:
                p_c+=1
                if p_c==3:
                    break
                else:
                    print("Wrong Password")
                    continue
    else:
        u_c+=1
        if u_c==3:
            break
        else:
            print("Wrong UserName")
            continue
                
    break
if uname=='siva':
    if pwd=='krish@123':
        print("Successfully Login")
    else:
        print("sorry, you are enter maximum no.of times wrong password\
,try again after sometime")
else:
    print("sorry, you are enter maximum no.of times wrong username\
,try again after sometime")

	output1
	--------
enter your user name: abc
Wrong UserName
enter your user name: pqr
Wrong UserName
enter your user name: xyz
sorry, you are enter maximum no.of times wrong username,try again after sometime

	output2
	--------
enter your user name: siva
enter your password: abc@123
Wrong Password
enter your password: siva@123
Wrong Password
enter your password: krishna
sorry, you are enter maximum no.of times wrong password,try again after sometime

	output3
	-------
enter your user name: siva
enter your password: krish@123
Successfully Login

pass statement:
---------------
pass is a keyword in python, which is used to create a empty block i.e., empty if block, else block,while block,for block,function block,class block and method block in python.
