Number Systems:
---------------
the Number System's are used to represent the numbers in a computer memory.

the number system's can be categorized into 4 type's, they are

	1). Binary Number System's

	2). Octal Number System's

	3). Decimal Number System's

	4). Hexadecimal Number System's


Binary Number System's:
-----------------------
the Binary Number System base value is 2

it contains 0 to 1

we can represent the Binary Number System's in python, that number system contains prefix with 0b.

	ex: 0b1010

Octal Number System's:
-----------------------
the Octal Number System base value is 8

it contains 0 to 7

we can represent the Octal Number System's in python, that number system contains prefix with 0o.

	ex: 0o37

Decimal Number System's:
------------------------
the Decimal Number System base value is 10

it contains 0 to 9

don't required any special charecter to represent the Decimal Number System's in python.

in python, the decimal number system contains 0 but don't startswith 0.

	ex: 39
	    309
	    039 #invalid

Hexadecimal Number System's:
----------------------------
the Hexadecimal Number System base value is 16

it contains 0 to 15(0123456789abcdef)

we can represent the Hexadecimal Number System's in python, that number system contains prefix with 0x.

	ex: 0x2c

ex:
---
>>> x=0b1010 #binary
>>> x
10 #decimal

>>> y=0o37 #octal
>>> y
31 #decimal

>>> z=39 #decimal
>>> z
39 #decimal

>>> p=0x2c #hexadecimal
>>> p
44 #decimal

note:
----
in python, we can pass any number system as a input to the python interpreter by default our python interpreter to convert that number system into decimal number system only.

if we want to our required number system as a output, in that case we are using number system conversions concept.

Number System Conversions:
--------------------------
the Number System Conversions are used to convert the one number sytem into another number system.

	1). to convert Binary into Decimal

ex:
---
>>> x=0b1011 #binary
>>> x
11

	2). to convert Decimal into Binary

in python, we can convert any number system into Binary, in that case we are using bin() function.

>>> y=19 #decimal
>>> bin(y)
0b10011 

	3). to convert Octal into Decimal

>>> x=0o37 #octal
>>> x
31

	4). to convert Decimal into Octal

in python, we can convert any number system into Octal number system, in that case we are using oct() function.

>>> y=39 #decimal
>>> oct(y)
0o47

	5). to convert Hexadecimal into Decimal

>>> x=0x2c #hexadecimal
>>> x
44

	6). to convert Decimal into Hexadecimal

in python, to convert any number system into hexadecimal number system, in that case we are using hex() function.

>>> y=62 #decimal
>>> hex(y)
0x3e

	7). to convert Binary into Octal

>>> x=0b1011 #binary
>>> oct(x)
0o13

	8). to convert Octal into Binary

>>> y=0o37 #octal
>>> bin(y)
0b11111
