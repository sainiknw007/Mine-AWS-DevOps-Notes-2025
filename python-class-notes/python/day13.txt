in python, the string object support indexing concept.

in python, the indexing can be categorized into 2 type's, they are

	1).Forward/Positive Indexing

	2).Backward/Negative Indexing


		    Indexing
		       |
	---------------------------------
	|                       	|
Positive/Forward		Negative/Backward
	|				|
takes from left to right	takes from right to left
	|				|
by default starts with 0	by default starts with -1

in string object, each and every charecter having unique indexing.

by using indexing concept, we can retreive only one charecter from the string object at a time

ex:
---
>>> x="siva krishna"
>>> x
'siva krishna'
>>> x[2]
'v'
>>> x[4]
' '
>>> x[9]
'h'
>>> x[-3]
'h'
>>> x[-8]
' '
>>> x[-10]
'v'
>>> x[12]
IndexError: string index out of range	

the string object supporting slicing concept.

by using slicing concept, we can retreive one or more charecters from the string object at a time.

	scenario-1
	-----------
	if we want to retreive last-N charecters from the string object at a time, in that case we are using following syntax,

	strobj[start:]

	here the start index value is a inclusive value
	     by default increment by 1

ex:
---
>>> x="siva krishna"
>>> x
'siva krishna'
>>> x[5:]
'krishna'
>>> x[-7:]
'krishna'
>>> x[-4:]
'shna'

	scenario-2
	-----------
	if we want to retreive first-N charecters from the string object at a time, in that case we are using following syntax,

	strobj[:stop]

	here the stop index value is a exclusive value
	     by default increment by 1
	     by default starts with 0

ex:
---
>>> x="siva krishna"
>>> x
'siva krishna'
>>> x[:4]
'siva'
>>> x[:-8]
'siva'

	scenario-3
	-----------
	if we want to retreive some middle charecters from the string object, in that case we are using following syntax

	strobj[start:stop]

	here the start index is a inclusive value
	     the stop index is a exclusive value
	     by default increment by 1

ex:
---
>>> x="siva krishna"
>>> x
'siva krishna'
>>> x[5:10]
'krish'
>>> x[-7:-2]
'krish'
>>> x[3:6]
'a k'
>>> x[-9:-6]
'a k'
>>> x[4:5]
' '
>>> x[4] #indexing
' '

ex:
---
>>> x="siva krishna"
>>> x
'siva krishna'
>>> x[::2]
'sv rsn'
>>> x[::-2]
'ahikai'
>>> x[::1]
'siva krishna'
>>> x[::-1]
'anhsirk avis'
>>> x[::2]
'sv rsn'
>>> x[1::2]
'iakiha'

ex:
---
>>> x="siva krishna"
>>> x[5::2]
'kiha'
>>> x[5:10:2]
'kih'
>>> x[5:10:2][::-1]
'hik'

ex:
---
>>> x="siva krishna"
>>> x[0]
's'
>>> x[-1]
'a'
>>> x[1:-1]
'iva krishn'
>>> x[-1]+x[1:-1]+x[0]
'aiva krishns'
