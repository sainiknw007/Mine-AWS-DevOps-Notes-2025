implementations of Python:
---------------------------
the python runtime environment is implemented by using 'C Programming', is known as a 'cpython'.

the 'cpython' is a standrad,builtin and most widely used python implementation.

the python runtime environment is implemented by using 'Java Programming', is known as a 'Jython'.

the python runtime environment is implemented by using '.Net Frameworks', is known as a 'IronPython'.

the python runtime environment is implemented by using 'Rust Programming', is known as a 'RustPython'.

the python runtime environment is implemented by Anaconda Corporation, is known as a 'AnacondaPython'.

the python runtime environment is implemented based on 'embeded systems', is known as a 'Embedded Python'.

the python runtime environment is implemented by itself i.e., without using other programming language stack, is known as a 'StacklessPython/Stackless'.

whenever we are adding the JIT(Just In Time) compiler to the CPython for faster execution, is known as a 'PYPY'.

	......,ETC.,


what is Comment?
----------------
A comment is a part of a program's source code that is ignored by the compiler or interpreter.

A comment is basically a text note that gives an explanation about the source code.

We can include the comments in our source code, to increase the readability of the program.

how to represent the Comments in Python?
----------------------------------------
we can represents the comments in python, in two ways

	1).single line comment

		# comment_line

	2).multi line comment

		''' comment_line_1
		    comment_line_2
	                .....
		    comment_line_n '''

ex
---
	demo.py
	------
'''write a python program to perform arithmetic calculations:
    1).Addition
    2).Subtraction
    3).Multiplication
    4).Division '''

#variable decleration
x=10
y=20
print(x+y) #addition
print(x-y) #subtraction
print(x*y) #multiplication
print(x/y) #division


Versions of Python:
------------------
initially the python released into the market in the year of 1991.

the python1.0 version is released into the market in the year of 1994.

the python1.x(1.0,1.1,1.2,....) versions don't support Garbage Collector concept.

the python2.0 version is released into the market in the year of 2000.

from python2.0 version onwards the python language also support Garbage Collector concept.

the python3.0 version is released into the market in the year of 2008.

	python3.x	--> 3.0,3.1,3.2,....,3.12.6(6th sep 2024)

note:
-----
the PSF(Python Software Foundation) Team completly to stop the python2.x versions.

the python2.7.18(20th apr 2020) is the last release of python2.x versions.

Python Environment Setup:
------------------------
the Python Environment Setup can be categorized into 3 parts, they are

	1). Downloading Python Software

	2). Install Python Software

	3). Python Path Setup

How to Downloading Python Software?
------------------------------------
	goto www.python.org
		|
	goto downloads
		|
	select our operating system
	     (windows)
		|
	to download any one file related to that 
	particular operating system bit number
	(windows installer file)

How to Install Python Software?
--------------------------------
	double click on Python3.x version related downloaded file
			|
	to enable admin priviliges and to select any one option(custom/installNow)
			|
	to enable all the optional features and click on next
			|
	to select installation location and click on install button
			|
		click on yes


what is Path?
--------------
a path defines the location of a file or folder in a computer's file system

The PATH environment variable, also referred to as just PATH or Path

what is Python path?
--------------------
Python path is a special environment variable that provides guidance to the Python interpreter about where to find various libraries and applications.

why we need to set the python path?
-----------------------------------
	after installation of python software by default we can access the python interpreter on top of that particular installtion location only.

ex:
---
C:\Users\Lenovo>python
	"python" is not recognized

C:\Users\Lenovo>cd ..

C:\Users>cd ..

C:\>cd Python312

C:\Python312>python
Python 3.12.5 

>>> print("hello world")
hello world
>>> ^Z  #ctrl+z


C:\Python312>d:

D:\>python
	"python" is not recognized

D:\>

	
	if we want to access the python interpreter on top of any location in our computer/system, in that case we need to set the python path.


how to set the python path?
----------------------------
we can set the python path in two scenarios, they are

	scenario-1: temporary purpose i.e., temporary path setup

	scenario-2: permanent purpose i.e., permanent path setup

temporary path setup:
---------------------
	if we want to set the python path temporarly, in that case we are using following command,

	set path="python_installation_location"

ex:
---
C:\Users\Lenovo>set path="C:\Python312"


permanent path setup:
--------------------
	if we want to set the python path permanently, in that case we are follow the following steps,

	goto ThisPC
	     |
	Right click on ThisPC
	     |
	click on Properties
	     |
	click on Advanced System Settings
	     |
	click on Environment variables
	     |
	goto system variables
	     |
	to select path variable and click on edit
(windows8,10,11 versions, again click on edit text and click on ok)
	     |
	to put ; and to add our python installation location
	     |
	click on ok
	     |
	click on ok
	     |
	click on ok
