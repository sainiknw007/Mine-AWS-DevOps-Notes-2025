	input				output
	-----				-------
	[5,3,7,9]			[3,5,7,9]

sol:
----
x=eval(input("enter your list: ")) 
for i in range(len(x)):
    for j in range(i+1,len(x)):
        if x[i]>x[j]:
            x[i],x[j]=x[j],x[i]
        
print(x)


Assignment-6:
-------------

	input				output
	-----				-------
	[5,3,7,9]			[9,7,5,3]

sol:
---
x=eval(input("enter your list: ")) 
for i in range(len(x)):
    for j in range(i+1,len(x)):
        if x[i]<x[j]:
            x[i],x[j]=x[j],x[i]
        
print(x)


Assignment-7:

write a python program to read the list as a input from the user and to return the elements in reverse order, without using reversed() function and reverse() method?

	input				output
	-----				-------
	[5,3,7,9]			[9,7,3,5]


sol:
----
x=eval(input("enter your list: "))
y=[]
for i in range(len(x)-1,-1,-1):
    y.append(x[i])
        
print(y)


Assignment-8:
-------------
write a python program to read the list as a input from the user and to find the mean and median values?

	input				output
	-----				-------
	[5,3,7,9]			6.0(mean)
					6.0(median)

	[3,6,2,7,4]			4.4(mean)
					4(median)		


Mean is also known as the arithmetic mean of the given data.

Median is the middlemost value of the given ungrouped data if the data is arranged in ascending order.

sol:
----
x=eval(input("enter your list: "))
mean=sum(x)/len(x)
x.sort()
if len(x)%2==0:
    i=(len(x)//2)-1
    j=i+1
    median=(x[i]+x[j])/2
else:
    i=len(x)//2
    median=x[i]
print(mean)
print(median)

	(or)

import pandas as pd
a=[4,3,5,7,2]
x=pd.Series(a)
print(x)
print(x.mean())
print(x.median())
b=[5,3,2,7,9,4]
y=pd.Series(b)
print(y)
print(y.mean())
print(y.median())

Assignment-9:
-------------
write a python program to read the list as a input from the user and to return the accumulated sum of the list?

	input				output
	-----				-------
	[5,3,7,9]			[5,8,15,24]

sol:
----
x=eval(input("enter your list: "))
s=0
y=[]
for ele in x:
    s+=ele
    y.append(s)
print(y)

	(or)

from itertools import accumulate
x=eval(input("enter your list: "))
print(list(accumulate(x)))
