Q1. How to delete tfstate file ?

Ways to Delete tfstate

1.Delete Locally (not recommended unless reset needed)

rm -f terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup

This removes the state file from your local system. After this, Terraform will think no resources exist, so a terraform apply will try to recreate everything. ⚠️ Dangerous if resources still exist in cloud.

2. If Using Remote Backend (e.g., S3, Azure, GCS)
You’d need to delete it from the backend storage:

S3: Go to the S3 bucket → delete terraform.tfstate.

Terraform CLI:

terraform state rm <resource_address>


(removes a resource from state without destroying it).

3. Safer Alternatives Instead of Full Deletion

Remove specific resources from state:

terraform state rm aws_instance.my_ec2


This makes Terraform “forget” the resource without deleting it in AWS.

Re-initialize backend state:

terraform init -reconfigure
